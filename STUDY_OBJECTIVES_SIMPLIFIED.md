# eGrowtify Study Objectives (Simplified for PPT)

## Main Objective
To analyze, design, and develop **eGrowtify** - a smart urban gardening platform that helps people practice sustainable gardening.

### 💬 What to Say:
"Before we start building anything, we need to understand the problem we're solving. Many people want to garden, but they struggle with knowing when to water, what to plant, or how to care for their plants. Our goal is to create eGrowtify - a smart platform that makes gardening easier and more accessible for everyone, whether you live in a small apartment or have a big backyard. We want to help people grow their own food and plants in a sustainable way."

## Objective 1: Understand Current Situation

**1.1** How people currently learn and practice gardening (urban, rural, outdoor)

**1.2** What problems do gardeners face?
- Beginners and experts
- Different settings: apartments, homes, outdoor gardens

**1.3** What digital tools and resources already exist for gardening?

### 💬 What to Say:
"First, we need to do our homework. We're going to research three main things:

**For 1.1**, we'll look at how people currently learn gardening. Do they watch YouTube videos? Read books? Ask friends? We want to understand the different ways people in cities, suburbs, and rural areas approach gardening.

**For 1.2**, we need to identify the real problems. Maybe beginners don't know when to water their plants. Maybe experienced gardeners struggle with pest control. We'll talk to people in different situations - those with tiny apartment balconies, those with big gardens, and everyone in between.

**For 1.3**, we'll check what's already out there. Are there apps? Websites? What do they do well? What's missing? This helps us make sure eGrowtify offers something new and better, not just another gardening app."

## Objective 2: Design the System Features

**2.1** Create plant care guides for vegetables, herbs, and fruits

**2.2** Build smart alerts for:
- Watering reminders
- Fertilizing schedules
- Pruning times
- General maintenance

**2.3** Develop seasonal planning tools that consider:
- Local weather
- Climate conditions
- Best planting times

**2.4** Add AI features:
- Plant identification from photos
- Soil analysis
- Personalized plant recommendations

### 💬 What to Say:
"This is where we design what eGrowtify will actually do. We're building four main features:

**For 2.1**, we'll create easy-to-follow guides. Think of it like a recipe book, but for plants. If someone wants to grow tomatoes, we'll tell them step-by-step: when to plant, how much water, what kind of soil, everything they need to know.

**For 2.2**, we're building a smart reminder system. You know how your phone reminds you to drink water? We'll do that, but for your plants. 'Hey, it's time to water your basil!' or 'Your tomatoes need fertilizer this week.' This way, people won't forget important care tasks.

**For 2.3**, we'll create a seasonal planner. Gardening isn't the same everywhere - what works in summer in one place might not work in another. We'll use local weather data to tell users 'Now is the perfect time to plant carrots in your area' or 'Wait two weeks before planting tomatoes.'

**For 2.4**, here's the cool part - AI! Users can take a photo of a plant, and our system will identify it. Or they can take a photo of their soil, and we'll analyze it. Then we can say 'Based on your soil, you should try growing these plants' or 'Your plant looks like it needs more sunlight.' It's like having a gardening expert in your pocket."

## Objective 3: Define Best Features

**3.1** Easy-to-use design for web and mobile

**3.2** Accurate AI for plant identification and soil analysis

**3.3** Personalized recommendations based on:
- User's space
- Growing conditions
- Preferences

**3.4** Smart notifications without needing special devices (IoT)

### 💬 What to Say:
"Now we need to make sure eGrowtify is actually good - not just functional, but excellent. Here's how:

**For 3.1**, we're focusing on user experience. If the app is confusing or hard to use, people won't use it. We want it to be so simple that even someone who's never gardened before can open it and immediately understand what to do. Whether they're on their phone or computer, it should feel natural and easy.

**For 3.2**, the AI needs to be accurate. If someone takes a photo and we tell them it's a tomato when it's actually a pepper, they'll lose trust in us. We'll train our AI with lots of plant images and test it thoroughly to make sure it's reliable. Same with soil analysis - we want to give accurate, helpful information.

**For 3.3**, personalization is key. A person living in a studio apartment needs different advice than someone with a big backyard. We'll ask users about their space, their climate, what they like to eat, and then give them recommendations that actually make sense for their situation. It's like having a personal gardening consultant.

**For 3.4**, we want smart notifications, but we don't want to require expensive gadgets. No need to buy special sensors or devices. We'll use weather data, user input, and smart algorithms to send helpful reminders at the right time. It's smart, but accessible to everyone."

## Objective 4: Measure User Acceptance

Test if the system is useful for:

**4.1** Urban residents with small spaces (apartments, balconies)

**4.2** Rural gardeners wanting better tools and knowledge

**4.3** Beginners needing step-by-step guidance

**4.4** Community groups promoting sustainable gardening

### 💬 What to Say:
"Finally, we need to make sure people actually want to use eGrowtify. We'll test it with different groups of users:

**For 4.1**, we'll work with people who live in cities with limited space. Maybe they have a small balcony or just a windowsill. We want to see if eGrowtify helps them grow herbs or small vegetables successfully. We'll ask: 'Does this make sense for your situation? Is it helpful?'

**For 4.2**, we'll test with rural gardeners who might already know a lot about gardening. They might have big gardens and years of experience. We want to see if eGrowtify adds value for them - maybe through better planning tools or new techniques they haven't tried.

**For 4.3**, beginners are really important. If someone has never gardened before, will eGrowtify guide them successfully? We'll watch them use the app and see if they can follow the instructions and actually grow something. If beginners can succeed, we know we've done our job right.

**For 4.4**, we'll partner with community gardens and sustainability groups. These are people who are already passionate about gardening and want to share knowledge. We'll see if eGrowtify can help them organize better, share information, and grow their community impact.

After testing with all these groups, we'll have real feedback. We'll know what works, what doesn't, and how to improve. The goal is to make sure eGrowtify is actually useful for real people in real situations."

- ✅ Create an easy-to-use platform
- ✅ Help urban and rural gardeners succeed

### 💬 What to Say:
"To wrap up, eGrowtify is all about making gardening accessible and successful for everyone. We're not just building an app - we're creating a comprehensive solution that:

First, understands the real problems gardeners face through research and user interviews.

Second, provides smart tools powered by AI that can identify plants, analyze conditions, and give personalized advice.

Third, makes everything easy to use, whether you're a complete beginner or an experienced gardener.

And finally, we'll test it with real users to make sure it actually works for people in cities, suburbs, rural areas, and community gardens.

Our vision is simple: we want to help more people grow their own food and plants, no matter where they live or how much experience they have. Thank you, and we're happy to answer any questions!"
